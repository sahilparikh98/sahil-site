This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## sahil-site

This is my personal website. It's quite basic, written in ReactJS and Bootstrap 4. I do have plans to migrate to Typescript later. 
Occasionally, I will test out ideas and components in this web app, so it may be a work in progress. See the issues tab for what I'm working on.
I would also love some design suggestions or bugs you find on the site. It's really just a practice ground for my skills in web development.
