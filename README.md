This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## sahil-site

This is my personal website. It's quite basic, written in ReactJS and Bootstrap 4. I do have plans to migrate to Typescript later. 
Occasionally, I will test out ideas and components in this web app, so it may be a perpetual work in progress. See the issues tab for what I'm working on.
I would also love some design suggestions or bugs you find on the site. It's really just a practice ground for my skills in web development.

The main philosophy of this site is to *build from scratch*. So you'll see that other than using Bootstrap for styling and responsive layouts, I'm trying to focus on putting the functionality of the site together using just React and my brain. There are a lot of ways to more easily accomplish what this site does, but then I wouldn't learn anything would I?
