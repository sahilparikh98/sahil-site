This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## sahil-site

This is my personal website. It's quite basic, written in ReactJS and Bootstrap 4. I do have plans to migrate to Typescript later. 
Occasionally, I will test out ideas and components in this web app, so it may be a perpetual work in progress. See the issues tab for what I'm working on.
I would also love some design suggestions or bugs you find on the site. It's really just a practice ground for my skills in web development.

The main philosophy of this site is to *build from scratch*. So you'll see that other than using Bootstrap for basic styling and responsive layouts, I'm trying to focus on putting the rest of the site together using just React and my brain. There are a lot of ways to more easily accomplish what this site does, but then I wouldn't learn anything would I?

### I want to build a website too, but I don't have all of this time

This can be quite the undertaking, especially if you're like me and you're trying to learn. I have always wanted to do this, but I waited for a time period in which I had some uninterruppted time to really focus and motivate myself through the ups and downs of web development. If you want something quickly, some great resources for building your site easily are [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), which allows you to basically write your whole website in Markdown. Easy! I used this to build my website before this one. Or check out [urspace.io](https://urspace.io), it takes in your resume and builds you a really clean looking, portfolio style site. Both of these are really great options.

### I have the time

Great! Here I've detailed the steps I took to develop a website that I wanted.

#### Design

I actually took the time to develop the design for my site in Figma. Figma is a really great tool that can help you plan out designs, and it's fairly easy to use too. I designed each page of my site using their platform. The design of my site isn't very intense, as you can see, but it was a good opportunity to learn some of the basics of Figma.

#### Stack

I decided to leverage the basics on this site in order to learn them well. There are other easier alternatives, like GatsbyJS, which is fantastic at static sites, that I could have picked up, but I wanted to work simply with React and learn how to put a site together with just React.    

I've also used Bootstrap for most of my layout and the nav-bar. Bootstrap is really nice because it's the industry standard for many current design and layout paradigms, and offers great plug-and-play features. It was really nice to use it for my responsive layouts.
